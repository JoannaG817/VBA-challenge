MODULE 02: FUNDAMENTALS OF PROGRAMMING, CONTROL FLOW, AND SCRIPTING IN VBA
----------------------------------------------------------
Overview
----------------------------------------------------------
In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a script that loops through all the stocks of an excel worksheet for one year and outputs the following information:

1. The ticker symbol (AAB, AAF, AAR, Etc...)

2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4. The total stock volume of the stock. 

I added functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

Made adjustments to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
